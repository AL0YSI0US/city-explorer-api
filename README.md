## ‚öôÔ∏è Set up your server repository : Feature One

{ `Back End` }

- [X] Create a new repo called `city-explorer-api` on GitHub, initialized with a README file. Clone it locally, and do all your work on a meaningfully-named feature branch off of `main`.
- [X] Run the command `npm init` to create a new project. Answer the prompts with reasonable answers, or just hit enter to accept the defaults. Review the `package.json` file that it creates for you, and edit it if desired.
- [X] Use `npm install` to add the required dependencies to this project: `express`, `dotenv`, and `cors`.
- [X] Manually add the remaining files identified in the folder tree above. Put appropriate content into `.gitignore` and `.eslintrc.json`.
- [X] Copy the contents of [weather.json](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide-react/curriculum/class-07/lab/starter-code/data/weather.json) and paste it into your (otherwise empty) local `/data/weather.json`.
- [X] Set the contents of .env to set a value for `PORT`. Ensure `.env` is in your `.gitignore` file.
- [X] Populate your `README.md` file with the template provided in the lab. Fill in what you can at this point, and the rest before you submit your finalized assignment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Weather : Feature Two

As a user of City Explorer, I want to see weather info for the city I searched, so that I know how to pack for an upcoming trip.

**Given** that a user enters a valid location in the input
**When** the user clicks the "Explore!" button
**Then** some old weather data will be displayed on the page

{ `Back End` }

- [ ] Create a basic Express server. Verify it runs without errors.
- [ ] Create an API endpoint of `/weather` that processes a `GET` request that contains `lat` and `lon` information.
- [ ] Create a constructor function for a `Forecast` object, that has a properties of `date` and `description`.
- [ ] Using each data point from the static data, create an array of `Forecast` objects, one for each day. Do the necessary data munging to ensure the objects you create contain the information as required for correct client rendering. See the sample response.
- [ ] Send the full array back to the client who requested data from the `weather` endpoint.
- [ ] Test your endpoint in the browser, to verify the raw response object is coming through as expected.

{ `Front End` }

- [ ] When a city search successfully returns `lat` and `lon` info, immediately create a new request (lat/lon included) to your server's `/weather` endpoint.
- [ ] Create a new `Weather.js` component to render forecast data to the page.
- [ ] When the server returns the array of forecast data, show the Weather component, populated with the server data.
- [ ] Use appropriate Bootstrap components to nicely display the forecast data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Errors : Feature Three

As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.

**Given** that the server responds with an error code for any API endpoint
**When** the user clicks the "Explore!" button
**Then** the user will receive an error message on the page and the data will not be rendered

- [ ] Create a function to handle errors from any API call.
- [ ] Send a status of 500 along with an error message to the client.
